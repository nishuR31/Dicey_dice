# Dicey_dice
A Python script simulates a dice roll using the random and colorama libraries. It presents a menu to roll a dice (1) or exit (0), handling invalid inputs with error messages. Rolls a number between 1 and 6, displaying results in color. Uses a loop for continuous user interaction until exit.
